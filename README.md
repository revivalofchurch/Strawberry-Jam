## 👩‍💻 For Developers

Want to run Strawberry Jam from its source code, make your own changes, or create plugins? Here's how to get started:

1.  **Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org):** You'll need Node.js to run the project and manage its components.
2.  **Get the Code:**
    *   Open your terminal or command prompt.
    *   Use git to clone the repository (download the code):
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/glvckoma/strawberry-jam.git
        ```
    *   Navigate into the project directory:
        ```bash
        cd strawberry-jam
        ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    *   This command downloads all the necessary bits and pieces the project relies on:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
4.  **Run in Development Mode:**
    *   To run the application for development (e.g., to test changes as you make them):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
5.  **Build for Distribution (Optional):**
    *   If you want to create a packaged version of the application (like the `.exe` installer or a version for Mac/Linux) that you can share or install:
        ```bash
        npm run build
        ```
    *   This will create the distributable files in a `dist` or `release` folder (the exact location might vary based on configuration).
