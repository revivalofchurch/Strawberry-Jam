# Packets Documentation

Welcome to the Packets documentation! This section explains how Animal Jam communicates over the internet and how Strawberry Jam can intercept and modify these communications.

## What are Packets?

**Packets** are like digital letters that get sent between your computer and Animal Jam's servers. Every time something happens in the game - you move, chat, enter a room, or trade - your computer sends a packet to Animal Jam's servers telling them what you did.

Think of it like this:
- **You walk into a room** → Your computer sends a "I'm entering this room" packet
- **You say something in chat** → Your computer sends a "Here's my chat message" packet  
- **Someone else moves** → The server sends you a "Player X moved to this position" packet

## How Animal Jam's Network Protocol Works

### The Basic Flow
1. **Your Action**: You do something in the game (move, chat, etc.)
2. **Game Creates Packet**: Animal Jam creates a packet describing what you did
3. **Packet Sent**: The packet travels over the internet to Animal Jam's servers
4. **Server Processes**: Animal Jam's servers figure out what to do with your action
5. **Response Sent**: The servers send back packets telling your game what happened
6. **Game Updates**: Your game updates to show the results

### Without Strawberry Jam
```
Your Computer ←→ Internet ←→ Animal Jam Servers
```

### With Strawberry Jam
```
Your Computer ←→ Strawberry Jam ←→ Internet ←→ Animal Jam Servers
```

Strawberry Jam sits in the middle and can:
- **See** all packets going both directions
- **Modify** packets before they reach their destination
- **Block** packets from being sent
- **Create** new fake packets

## Types of Network Messages

Animal Jam uses three main types of packets:

### **XML Messages**
These are used for basic server communication and login processes.

**What they look like**: Like a structured document with tags
**Example purpose**: Logging into the game, getting server information
**When you see them**: Mostly during login and initial connection

**Think of XML messages like**: Official forms you fill out at a government office - they have a very specific format and are used for important administrative tasks.

### **XT Messages** (Animal Jam's Main Protocol)
These are Animal Jam's custom message format and handle most game actions.

**What they look like**: Text with percentage signs separating different parts
**Example purposes**: 
- Moving your animal around
- Sending chat messages  
- Joining/leaving rooms
- Trading items
- Playing games

**Think of XT messages like**: Text messages between friends - they're quick, informal, and used for everyday communication.

### **JSON Messages**
These are used for some newer features and data exchange.

**What they look like**: Structured data in a modern format
**Example purposes**: Some modern game features, data synchronization
**When you see them**: Less common, but used for specific features

**Think of JSON messages like**: Email attachments with organized data - they carry more complex information in a structured way.

## How Strawberry Jam Intercepts Packets

### The Proxy Server
Strawberry Jam runs what's called a **proxy server**. Think of it like a helpful post office worker:

1. **Mail Collection**: All your packets get sent to the Strawberry Jam proxy first
2. **Mail Inspection**: The proxy looks at each packet to see what it contains
3. **Mail Processing**: Plugins can modify, block, or copy the packets
4. **Mail Delivery**: The (possibly modified) packets get sent to their final destination

### Port Detection
Animal Jam can use different "ports" (like different phone numbers) to communicate. Strawberry Jam automatically tries several common ports:
- **443** (HTTPS)
- **444** 
- **445**
- **8443**
- **9443**

Think of ports like different phone lines - Animal Jam might use any of them, so Strawberry Jam checks them all.

### Message Parsing
When a packet arrives, Strawberry Jam:

1. **Receives Raw Data**: Gets the packet as it was sent
2. **Determines Type**: Figures out if it's XML, XT, or JSON
3. **Parses Content**: Breaks down the packet into understandable parts
4. **Makes Available**: Gives plugins access to the parsed information

## How Packets Can Be Manipulated

### Viewing Packets
**What this means**: Looking at packets without changing them
**Why it's useful**: 
- Understanding how the game works
- Debugging connection problems
- Learning about game mechanics
- Monitoring what's happening

**Example**: Username Logger plugin watches for packets that contain usernames and saves them for later viewing.

### Modifying Packets
**What this means**: Changing packets before they reach their destination
**Why it's useful**:
- Fixing game bugs
- Adding new features
- Customizing game behavior
- Testing modifications

**Example**: You could modify a chat message packet to change what you're saying before other players see it.

### Blocking Packets
**What this means**: Preventing packets from being sent or received
**Why it's useful**:
- Preventing unwanted actions
- Stopping spam or harassment
- Controlling what information gets shared
- Privacy protection

**Example**: Invisible Toggle plugin blocks packets that tell other players where you are, making you appear invisible.

### Injecting Packets
**What this means**: Creating and sending new packets that didn't originally exist
**Why it's useful**:
- Automating game actions
- Testing game features
- Creating new functionality
- Simulating user actions

**Example**: Spammer plugin creates many chat message packets and sends them quickly to post repeated messages.

## Packet Manipulation with the Spammer Plugin

The **Spammer plugin** is a perfect example of how packet manipulation works:

### How Spammer Works

#### **Step 1: User Input**
- User types a message in the Spammer interface: "Hello everyone!"
- User sets number of times to send: 5
- User clicks "Start Spam"

#### **Step 2: Packet Creation**
- Spammer plugin creates a chat message packet
- The packet contains the message "Hello everyone!"
- The packet is formatted as an XT message (Animal Jam's chat format)

#### **Step 3: Packet Injection**
- Spammer sends the packet to Strawberry Jam's network system
- Strawberry Jam forwards the packet to Animal Jam's servers
- Animal Jam's servers think you typed the message normally

#### **Step 4: Repetition**
- Spammer repeats this process 5 times
- Each packet gets sent separately
- The result: "Hello everyone!" appears in chat 5 times

### Why This is Useful for Testing

**Server Response Testing**:
- See how Animal Jam handles lots of messages at once
- Test if there are rate limits or spam protection
- Understand how chat systems work

**Plugin Development**:
- Test how other plugins respond to chat messages
- Debug message handling systems
- Verify that packet creation works correctly

**Game Mechanics Research**:
- Learn about Animal Jam's network protocol
- Understand message formatting requirements
- Study server behavior patterns

## Safety and Responsible Use

### Understanding Risks

#### **Account Safety**
- **Spam Protection**: Animal Jam has systems to detect unusual activity
- **Rate Limiting**: Sending too many packets too fast might trigger protections
- **Behavioral Detection**: Obvious automation might be noticed by moderators

#### **Game Stability**
- **Malformed Packets**: Badly formatted packets might cause crashes
- **Server Overload**: Too many packets might affect game performance
- **Unintended Effects**: Modified packets might cause unexpected game behavior

### Best Practices

#### **Start Small**
- Test with simple, harmless packets first
- Send only a few packets at a time initially
- Make sure you understand what each packet does

#### **Use Realistic Timing**
- Don't send packets faster than a human could
- Add delays between messages
- Vary timing to appear more natural

#### **Test Safely**
- Use test accounts when possible
- Don't test on your main account
- Start in private areas (dens) before public rooms

#### **Monitor Results**
- Watch for error messages or unusual game behavior
- Check if your packets are having the intended effect
- Stop immediately if something seems wrong
