## Key Concepts

### Dual-Process Architecture
Strawberry Jam runs two separate programs that work together:
- **Main Client**: The control center that manages plugins and network traffic
- **Game Client**: The actual Animal Jam game window with enhanced features

This separation provides better security, stability, and flexibility.

### Plugin System
Plugins are add-on modules that extend Strawberry Jam's functionality:
- **UI Plugins**: Create user interfaces and control panels
- **Game Plugins**: Modify gameplay and game behavior
- **Live Loading**: Plugins can be enabled/disabled without restarting

### Network Interception
Strawberry Jam sits between your game and Animal Jam's servers:
- **Monitoring**: See all network traffic in real-time
- **Modification**: Change messages before they're sent or received
- **Injection**: Create and send custom messages
- **Analysis**: Study how Animal Jam's protocol works

## Safety and Responsibility

### Important Reminders
- **Account Safety**: Always test on non-main accounts when possible
- **Respect Others**: Don't use modifications to harm or harass other players
- **Follow Terms of Service**: Respect Animal Jam's rules and guidelines
- **Start Small**: Test modifications carefully before using them extensively

### Best Practices
- **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of important files before making changes
- **Incremental Testing**: Test small changes before making larger ones
- **Safe Development**: Use development accounts for plugin testing
- **Responsible Use**: Consider the impact of your modifications on others
